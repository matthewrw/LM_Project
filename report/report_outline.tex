\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}

\item overview
\item why are fires important: fires are bad, but if we can stop them early, then they are less bad
\item inference vs prediction (we are doing inference)
\item why is inference better for this problem
\item this paper is organized as follows

\end{itemize}

\section{Background}

\begin{itemize}

\item summary of reference paper
\item how data was collected
\item goal
\item restate prediction problem

\end{itemize}

\section{Modeling/Analysis}

\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}

\begin{itemize}

\item initial ideas: what should matter, types of covariates (spatial, temporal, index)
\item first plots
\item identify problems (colinearity, skewness)

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feature Design}

\begin{itemize}

\item transformations
\item creations

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Variable Selection}

\begin{itemize}

\item FFMC
\item LASSO
\item tradeoff between interpretability for inference vs prediction
\item creation of competing models - with and without FFMC
\item spatial data - what we have, how we condensed it, variables we made, plots we used including google maps

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Modeling}

\begin{itemize}

\item types of model we considered: weighted, mixed intercept, good ol lm
\item someone please bootstrap something
\item best 2 models
\item model comparison
\item our choice and why

\end{itemize}

\section{Prediction}

\begin{itemize}

\item apply best model to test set
\item report diagnostics
\item report p-values
\item MSE or some loss function
\item final inferences

\end{itemize}
